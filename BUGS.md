# Bug with thinking on dial

```
Stream Error: messages.1.content.0.type: Expected thinking or redacted_thinking, but found text. When thinking is enabled, a final assistant message must start with a thinking block (preceeding the lastmost set of tool_use and tool_result blocks). We recommend you include thinking blocks from previous turns. To avoid this requirement, disable thinking. Please consult our documentation at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking
