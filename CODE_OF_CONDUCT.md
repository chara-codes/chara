We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, health conditions, ethnicity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sex.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Showing empathy and kindness toward others
* Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and graciously accepting constructive feedback
* Taking responsibility, apologizing for mistakes, and learning from experiences
* Focusing on the community's collective good rather than personal interests alone

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, or other contributions that violate this code of conduct.
