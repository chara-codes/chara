## Introduction

Chara Codes is an AI-powered development environment designed to streamline frontend development workflows. It combines AI assistance with intuitive tools to help developers write, review, and manage code more efficiently. The platform provides real-time AI suggestions, code generation, and project management capabilities through a modern web interface.
In Greek, the word 'chara' (œáŒ±œÅŒ¨) means 'joy' or 'happiness'. Chara Codes aims to bring joy to developers by simplifying and enhancing their coding experience.

## Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered code generation and suggestions
- üíª Intuitive split interface with chat and preview panels
- üìù Real-time code preview and editing
- üîÑ Seamless integration with multiple AI providers
- üåê Built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) support
- üìä Advanced code visualization and navigation
- üîç Smart code analysis and suggestions
- üñ•Ô∏è Focus on local environment changes with minimal setup
- üîå Support for multiple technology stacks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with the following packages:

- `@chara/web` - Next.js frontend application
  - Split interface for chat and preview
  - Real-time code editing and preview
  - Responsive UI built with Tailwind and shadcn/ui

- `@chara/server` - Backend server application
  - tRPC API with WebSocket support
  - Multiple AI provider integrations
  - SQLite/LibSQL database with Drizzle ORM
  - Streaming response support

- `./automation` - Testing framework
  - End-to-end testing with Playwright
  - AI-assisted test generation and validation
  - Visual regression testing
  - Streamlined helper patterns
  - Local-remote sync capabilities

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:chara-codes/chara.git

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development servers
bun dev
```

## Architecture

Chara uses a modern stack with:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Bun, tRPC, Drizzle ORM, LibSQL
- **AI**: Multiple provider support through AI SDK
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live updates
- **CLI**: Bun-powered command line tool

## Configuration

Each package can be configured independently:

- **Web**: Environment variables for API endpoints and features
- **Server**: `.env` file for database and AI provider settings
- **CLI**: `.chara.json` for project-specific configuration

See individual package READMEs for detailed configuration options.
