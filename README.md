## Introduction

Chara Codes is an AI-powered development environment designed to streamline frontend development workflows. It combines AI assistance with intuitive tools to help developers write, review, and manage code more efficiently. The platform provides real-time AI suggestions, code generation, and project management capabilities through a modern web interface.
In Greek, the word 'chara' (œáŒ±œÅŒ¨) means 'joy' or 'happiness'. Chara Codes aims to bring joy to developers by simplifying and enhancing their coding experience.

## Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered code generation and suggestions
- üíª Intuitive split interface with chat and preview panels
- üìù Real-time code preview and editing
- üîÑ Seamless integration with multiple AI providers
- üåê Built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) support
- üìä Advanced code visualization and navigation
- üîç Smart code analysis and suggestions
- üñ•Ô∏è Focus on local environment changes with minimal setup
- üîå Support for multiple technology stacks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with the following packages:

- `@chara/web` - Next.js frontend application
  - Split interface for chat and preview
  - Real-time code editing and preview
  - Responsive UI built with Tailwind and shadcn/ui

- `@chara/server` - Backend server application
  - tRPC API with WebSocket support
  - Multiple AI provider integrations
  - SQLite/LibSQL database with Drizzle ORM
  - Streaming response support

- `@chara/cli` - Command-line interface
  - AI-powered development assistant
  - Project setup and configuration
  - MCP server integration
  - Local development server management
  - Published to npm as `chara`

- `./automation` - Testing framework
  - End-to-end testing with Playwright
  - AI-assisted test generation and validation
  - Visual regression testing
  - Streamlined helper patterns
  - Local-remote sync capabilities

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:chara-codes/chara.git

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development servers
bun dev

# Or install the CLI globally
npm install -g chara
chara dev
```

## Docker Usage

Chara can be deployed using Docker for production environments. The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` configuration that sets up the following services:

- **traefik**: Reverse proxy/load balancer that handles routing, TLS termination, and provides a dashboard
- **charaserver**: Backend server application container
- **charaweb**: Next.js frontend application container
- **charatunnel**: Connection tunnel service for remote access

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- SSL certificates in the `./certs` directory
- Traefik dynamic configuration in `./traefik/dynamic`
- A `config.json` file for the tunnel service

### Running with Docker

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Configuration

The Docker setup uses Traefik as a reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS redirection and is configured to expose services on these domains:

- `web.chara-ai.dev` - Frontend application
- `server.chara-ai.dev` - Backend API
- `*.chara-ai.dev` - Dynamic tunnel subdomains

You can modify the domain names and other settings in the `docker-compose.yml` file or through Traefik's dynamic configuration.

## Architecture

Chara uses a modern stack with:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Bun, tRPC, Drizzle ORM, LibSQL
- **AI**: Multiple provider support through AI SDK
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live updates
- **CLI**: Bun-powered command line tool

## Configuration

Each package can be configured independently:

- **Web**: Environment variables for API endpoints and features
- **Server**: `.env` file for database and AI provider settings
- **CLI**: `.chara.json` for project-specific configuration

See individual package READMEs for detailed configuration options.

## CLI Publishing

The Chara CLI is automatically published to npm when changes are made to the `packages/cli` directory:

### Installation

```bash
# Install stable version
npm install -g chara

# Install alpha version (from playground branch)
npm install -g chara@alpha
```

### Publishing Process

- **Main branch**: Stable releases published with `latest` tag
- **Playground branch**: Alpha releases with timestamped versions and `alpha` tag
- **Automated**: GitHub Actions handle building and publishing
- **Manual**: Workflow can be triggered manually from Actions tab

### Version Management

```bash
# Bump version before merging to main
cd packages/cli
bun run version:patch   # or minor, major
bun run version:set 1.2.3
bun run version:current
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [CLI Publishing Guide](./.github/PUBLISHING.md).

## Release Management

Chara uses [Auto](https://github.com/intuit/auto) for automated release management. Releases are triggered by PR labels and happen automatically through GitHub Actions.

### For Contributors

When creating a PR, add one of these labels to determine the release type:

- `üí• Breaking Change` - Major version bump
- `üöÄ Feature` - Minor version bump  
- `üêõ Bug Fix` - Patch version bump
- `üìö Documentation` - Patch version bump
- `üè† Internal` - Patch version bump
- `üèÉ Performance` - Patch version bump
- `üì¶ Dependencies` - Patch version bump
- `üö´ Skip Release` - Skip this PR from releases

### Release Process

- **Main branch**: Production releases happen automatically when PRs are merged
- **Playground branch**: Canary releases for testing new features
- **Feature branches**: Can create canary releases for preview

### Manual Release Commands

```bash
# Check release status
bun run release:check

# Setup GitHub labels (run once)
bun run release:labels

# Create canary release
bun run release:canary

# Ship production release
bun run release
```

For detailed information, see [Release Management Guide](./docs/RELEASES.md) and [Migration Guide](./docs/MIGRATION_TO_AUTO.md).
