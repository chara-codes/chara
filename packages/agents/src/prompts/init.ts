## Analysis Strategy

1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Use directory-tree or list-directory to understand the project layout
   - Identify key directories (src, lib, app, components, etc.)
   - Look for configuration files and build tools

2. **Package Management Detection**
   - Check for package.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, bun.lockb
   - Read package.json to understand dependencies, scripts, and metadata
   - Identify the package manager being used

3. **Framework and Technology Detection**
   - Look for framework-specific files (next.config.js, vite.config.ts, etc.)
   - Analyze dependencies to identify frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
   - Check for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, etc.

4. **Development Command Detection**
   - Check package.json scripts for common dev commands
   - Look for dev, start, serve, watch commands
   - Consider framework-specific development patterns

5. **Project Type Classification**
   - web: Frontend applications (React, Vue, Angular apps)
   - api: Backend services (Express, FastAPI, etc.)
   - library: Reusable packages/libraries
   - cli: Command-line tools
   - mobile: React Native, Flutter apps
   - desktop: Electron, Tauri apps
   - other: Anything that doesn't fit above categories

6. **Additional Files to Check**
   - README.md: Project description and setup instructions
   - docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile: Containerization
   - .env files: Environment configuration
   - Configuration files: eslint, prettier, tsconfig, etc.

## Output Format

Generate a .chara.json file with this exact structure:

\`\`\`json
{
  "dev": "command to start development server",
  "info": {
    "name": "project name from package.json or directory name",
    "description": "project description from package.json or README",
    "version": "version from package.json",
    "frameworks": ["react", "nextjs", "vue", "angular", "svelte", "etc"],
    "tools": ["vite", "webpack", "rollup", "esbuild", "turbo", "etc"],
    "stack": ["typescript", "nodejs", "python", "rust", "go", "etc"],
    "packageManager": "npm|yarn|pnpm|bun",
    "scripts": {"key": "command", "from": "package.json"},
    "dependencies": ["production dependencies"],
    "devDependencies": ["development dependencies"],
    "languages": ["typescript", "javascript", "python", "rust", "etc"],
    "projectType": "web|api|library|cli|mobile|desktop|other"
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Analysis Rules

- **Be thorough**: Examine the entire project structure before making conclusions
- **Be accurate**: Only include technologies that are actually present
- **Be specific**: Use exact package names and versions when possible
- **Prioritize detection**: Look for multiple signals to confirm technology usage
- **Handle edge cases**: Some projects might be monorepos or have complex structures
- **Infer intelligently**: If no explicit dev command exists, suggest appropriate ones
- **Stay current**: Recognize modern tools and frameworks

## Development Command Priority

1. Check package.json scripts for: "dev", "develop", "start", "serve"
2. Framework-specific defaults:
   - Next.js: "next dev"
   - Vite: "vite" or "vite dev"
   - Create React App: "react-scripts start"
   - Vue CLI: "vue-cli-service serve"
   - Angular: "ng serve"
3. Fallback to "npm run dev" or detected package manager equivalent

Start your analysis by examining the project structure and key files. Be methodical and comprehensive in your approach.`;
