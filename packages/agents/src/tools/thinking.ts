  description: `A detailed tool for engineering-focused problem-solving through systematic, sequential thoughts.
This tool helps analyze complex technical problems using structured engineering methodologies.
Each thought should build upon previous analysis using sound engineering principles and practices.

Engineering Problem-Solving Focus:
- Apply systematic engineering methodologies (requirements analysis, design patterns, testing strategies)
- Consider scalability, maintainability, performance, and reliability implications
- Evaluate trade-offs between different technical approaches
- Follow engineering best practices and industry standards
- Consider system architecture, dependencies, and integration points
- Think through error handling, edge cases, and failure modes
- Plan for testing, deployment, and monitoring

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex technical problems into manageable engineering tasks
- System design and architecture planning
- Technical analysis requiring engineering rigor
- Code design and implementation planning
- Performance optimization and troubleshooting
- Infrastructure and deployment strategy
- Technical risk assessment and mitigation
- Multi-step engineering solutions requiring context maintenance

Key engineering features:
- Systematic decomposition of technical problems
- Structured analysis of requirements and constraints
- Evaluation of multiple solution approaches
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Design pattern identification and application
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Testing and validation strategy development

Engineering best practices:
1. Start with clear problem definition and requirements analysis
2. Consider multiple solution approaches and evaluate trade-offs
3. Think through system boundaries, interfaces, and dependencies
4. Plan for error handling, logging, and monitoring
5. Consider scalability, performance, and security implications
6. Apply appropriate design patterns and architectural principles
7. Plan testing strategy (unit, integration, system, performance)
8. Consider deployment, rollback, and operational concerns
9. Document key decisions and rationale
10. Validate solutions against requirements and constraints
11. Only set nextThoughtNeeded to false when engineering analysis is complete`,
