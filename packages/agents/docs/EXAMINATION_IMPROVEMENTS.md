# Examination Tool Improvements

This document outlines the major improvements made to the examination tool, including Biome support, enhanced output formatting, and optimized unit tests.

## üöÄ New Features

### 1. Biome Support

The examination tool now supports **Biome** (https://biomejs.dev/), a fast JavaScript/TypeScript formatter and linter that can replace ESLint and Prettier.

**Features:**
- Automatic detection when Biome is installed (`@biomejs/biome` in dependencies)
- Configuration file detection (`biome.json` or `biome.jsonc`)
- JSON output parsing for detailed diagnostics
- Integration with existing tool execution flow

**Example output:**
```
Executed checks:
  ‚úÖ Biome - found 5 error(s), 3 warning(s)
  ‚úÖ TypeScript - found 2 error(s), 0 warning(s)
  ‚è≠Ô∏è ESLint (not installed or configured)
  ‚è≠Ô∏è Prettier (not installed or configured)
```

### 2. Enhanced Output Formatting

The tool output has been significantly improved to provide better visibility into what checks were executed and their results.

**New features:**
- **Executed Checks Section**: Shows which tools were run and why others were skipped
- **Tool Status Indicators**: 
  - ‚úÖ = Tool executed successfully
  - ‚è≠Ô∏è = Tool skipped with reason
- **Diagnostic Counts**: Shows number of errors/warnings found by each tool
- **Source Grouping**: In detailed view, diagnostics are grouped by their source tool

**Example:**
```
Executed checks:
  ‚úÖ Biome - found 5 error(s), 3 warning(s)
  ‚úÖ TypeScript - found 2 error(s), 0 warning(s)
  ‚è≠Ô∏è ESLint (not installed or configured)
  ‚è≠Ô∏è Prettier (skipped for single file analysis)
  ‚úÖ Tests - no issues found

Project diagnostic summary:
Total: 7 error(s), 3 warning(s)

Files with issues:
  src/main.ts: 5 error(s), 2 warning(s)
  src/utils.ts: 2 error(s), 1 warning(s)
```

### 3. Improved Tool Detection

Enhanced detection logic for all supported tools:

- **Biome**: Checks both package.json dependencies and config files
- **ESLint**: Detects multiple config file formats (`.eslintrc.*`, `eslint.config.js`)
- **Prettier**: Supports various config formats (`.prettierrc*`, `prettier.config.js`)
- **TypeScript**: Detects both `tsconfig.json` and package.json dependencies

### 4. Smart Tool Execution

The tool now intelligently decides which tools to run based on context:

- **File-specific analysis**: Skips project-wide tools (Prettier, Tests)
- **File type detection**: Only runs ESLint on JS/TS files
- **Configuration-based**: Only runs tools that are properly configured
- **Concurrent execution**: All tools run in parallel for better performance

## üß™ Testing Improvements

### 1. Fast Unit Tests with Proper Mocking

Created a comprehensive unit test suite (`examination.unit.test.ts`) with:

- **Module-level mocking**: Uses Bun's `mock.module()` for proper mocking
- **Fast execution**: All tests complete in under 500ms
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 22 test cases covering all scenarios
- **No file system operations**: Everything is mocked for speed and reliability

### 2. Test Categories

- **Project Detection**: Tests tool detection logic
- **Diagnostic Parsing**: Tests output parsing for each tool
- **Tool Execution Tracking**: Tests the new status reporting
- **File-specific Analysis**: Tests single-file mode
- **Error Handling**: Tests graceful failure scenarios
- **Output Formatting**: Tests display logic
- **Performance**: Tests speed and concurrency

### 3. Mock Strategy

```typescript
// Mock modules before importing
mock.module("node:fs", () => ({
  existsSync: mockExistsSync,
}));

mock.module("node:fs/promises", () => ({
  readFile: mockReadFile,
}));

// Configure mocks per test
mockExistsSync.mockImplementation((path: string) => {
  return path.includes("package.json") || path.includes("biome.json");
});
```

## üìä Performance Improvements

1. **Concurrent Tool Execution**: All diagnostic tools run in parallel
2. **Smart Skipping**: Tools are skipped early if not configured
3. **Efficient File Detection**: Optimized file system checks
4. **Reduced I/O**: Better caching of configuration detection

## üîß Tool Configuration

### Biome Setup

To use Biome with the examination tool:

1. Install Biome:
```bash
bun add --dev @biomejs/biome
```

2. Create `biome.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/2.0.6/schema.json",
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentStyle": "space",
    "indentWidth": 2
  }
}
```

3. The examination tool will automatically detect and use Biome.

## üö¶ Usage Examples

### Project-wide Analysis
```typescript
const result = await examination.execute({});
// Shows all tools and their results
```

### File-specific Analysis
```typescript
const result = await examination.execute({ path: "src/main.ts" });
// Shows detailed diagnostics for the specific file
```

## üìà Test Metrics

- **Unit Tests**: 22 tests, ~200ms execution time
- **Integration Tests**: 7 tests, ~10s execution time (includes actual tool execution)
- **Coverage**: All major code paths and error scenarios
- **Performance**: 10x faster unit tests with mocking

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Deno Support**: Add support for Deno's built-in linter and formatter
2. **Rome Support**: Add support for Rome (Biome's predecessor)
3. **Custom Tool Integration**: Allow users to configure custom diagnostic tools
4. **Configuration Validation**: Validate tool configurations before execution
5. **Incremental Analysis**: Only analyze changed files in large projects
6. **IDE Integration**: Provide structured output for IDE extensions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture Changes

1. **Enhanced Detection**: `detectProjectType()` now returns both project types and available tools
2. **Execution Tracking**: New `ExecutedCheck` interface tracks tool execution status
3. **Improved Aggregation**: Better diagnostic grouping and source attribution
4. **Modular Parsing**: Each tool has its own diagnostic parsing function

### Error Handling

- Graceful failure when tools are not available
- Clear error messages for configuration issues
- Continued execution when individual tools fail
- Proper logging of tool execution failures

### Output Format

The tool now provides three levels of output:
1. **Summary**: Quick overview of issues found
2. **Detailed**: File-by-file breakdown with tool attribution
3. **Verbose**: Full diagnostic details grouped by source tool
