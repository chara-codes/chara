# Beautify Functionality

## Overview

The beautify functionality in the InputArea component enhances user-entered text using AI-powered text improvement. It replaces the previous simple text transformation logic with a sophisticated API-based solution that considers conversation context.

## Architecture

### Components Involved

- **InputArea Component**: UI component that triggers beautification
- **Chat Store**: Manages state and provides the `beautifyPrompt` method
- **Beautify Service**: Handles API communication with the beautification endpoint

### Data Flow

1. User enters text in the input field (>10 characters)
2. Beautify button becomes visible
3. User clicks beautify button
4. Component calls `beautifyPrompt` from chat store
5. Chat store calls beautify service with current prompt and message history
6. Service makes API request to beautification endpoint
7. Enhanced text is returned and displayed
8. Original text is preserved for undo functionality

## Implementation Details

### Chat Store Integration

The component imports and uses the chat store's `beautifyPrompt` method:

```tsx
const beautifyPrompt = useChatStore((state) => state.beautifyPrompt)
```

### Stream-Based Beautify Logic

The beautification process uses streaming for real-time updates:

```typescript
const callbacks: StreamCallbacks = {
  onTextDelta: (delta: string) => {
    beautifiedText += delta;
  },
  onStreamError: (error: string) => {
    streamError = error;
  },
  onCompletion: () => {
    // Stream completed successfully
  },
};

await processChatStream(apiUrl, payload, callbacks, abortController.signal);
```

Key features:
- Real-time text streaming with deltas
- 30-second timeout protection
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Context from recent message history
- Automatic cleanup and resource management

### Stream Service Integration

The beautify functionality leverages the existing stream service architecture:

- **Streaming Response**: Processes text deltas as they arrive from the AI model
- **Context Awareness**: Uses recent conversation history (last 5 messages) for better results
- **Optimized Prompting**: Specific instruction to return only improved text
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup with timeout and abort controllers

### Error Handling

- Stream connection failures are logged and handled gracefully
- Original text is preserved on any error condition
- Loading state is properly cleared in all scenarios
- Timeout protection prevents hanging requests (30s limit)
- Graceful fallback to original text when beautification fails
- User interface remains functional during and after errors

## User Experience

### Visual States

1. **Default State**: Beautify button hidden for short messages
2. **Available State**: Beautify button visible for messages >10 characters
3. **Loading State**: Loading animation, disabled controls, reduced opacity
4. **Beautified State**: Undo button replaces beautify button
5. **Error State**: Returns to original state with error logged

### Button Behavior

- **Beautify Button**: Appears for messages longer than 10 characters
- **Undo Button**: Appears after successful beautification
- **Disabled States**: During response, loading, or when input is empty/whitespace

### Loading Indicator

A animated loading line appears at the top of the input container during beautification, providing visual feedback to users.

## Configuration

### Button Configuration

Beautify functionality respects the button configuration system:

- Can be enabled/disabled through UI store configuration
- Tooltip text is configurable
- Integrates with existing button management system

### Environment Variables

The beautify service uses the following environment variable:

- `VITE_AGENTS_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the agents API (defaults to http://localhost:3031/)

## Stream API Specification

### Request Format

The beautify functionality now uses the stream service with the following payload structure:

```typescript
{
  messages: [
    ...recentMessages, // Last 5 messages for context
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Please improve and beautify the following text while preserving its meaning and intent. Return only the improved text without any additional explanation:\n\n${currentPrompt}"
    }
  ],
  model: string // Current model from chat store
}
```

### Stream Response Format

The response comes as streaming text deltas:

```
0:{"delta": "Improved"}
0:{"delta": " text"}
0:{"delta": " content."}
d:{"finishReason": "stop", "usage": {...}}
```

Stream types handled:
- `0:` Text deltas (accumulated into final result)
- `8:` Stream errors
- `d:` Completion signals
- `f:` Message finalization

### Error Handling

Stream errors are handled gracefully with:
- Timeout protection (30 seconds)
- Graceful degradation to original text
- Proper resource cleanup
- User-friendly error messages

## State Management

### Component State

- `originalText`: Stores the text before beautification for undo
- `isBeautified`: Tracks whether current text has been beautified
- `isBeautifyLoading`: Manages loading state during API calls

### Store Integration

- Uses chat store's `beautifyPrompt` method
- Integrates with UI store for button configuration
- Maintains separation of concerns between UI and business logic

## Testing

The beautify functionality includes comprehensive tests covering:

### Unit Tests

- Beautify button visibility logic
- API integration and error handling
- Loading states and user interactions
- Undo functionality
- Integration with chat store

### Test Coverage Areas

1. **Button Visibility**: Tests when beautify button appears/disappears
2. **API Integration**: Mocks and tests chat store integration
3. **Loading States**: Verifies loading indicators and disabled states
4. **Error Handling**: Tests graceful error recovery
5. **Undo Functionality**: Tests text restoration capabilities
6. **State Management**: Verifies proper state transitions

## Best Practices


### Performance

- Streaming responses provide real-time feedback
- Timeout protection prevents hanging requests
- Context optimization (last 5 messages only)
- Efficient text accumulation from stream deltas
- Proper resource cleanup and memory management
- Error boundaries prevent component crashes

### Accessibility

- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Clear visual indicators for different states

### User Experience

- Progressive enhancement (works without beautification)
- Graceful degradation on API failures
- Intuitive undo functionality
- Clear loading feedback

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Caching**: Store recent beautifications to reduce stream requests
2. **Offline Support**: Provide basic beautification when stream unavailable
3. **Customization**: Allow users to configure beautification preferences
4. **Batch Processing**: Support beautifying multiple messages
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Show partial results during streaming
6. **Adaptive Timeouts**: Adjust timeout based on text length
7. **Stream Reconnection**: Automatic retry on connection failures

### Extensibility

The current stream-based architecture supports easy extension for:

- Additional text enhancement features
- Different streaming AI providers
- Custom beautification rules and prompts
- User preferences and settings
- Multiple concurrent beautification streams
- Custom stream processing callbacks
- Advanced error recovery strategies
